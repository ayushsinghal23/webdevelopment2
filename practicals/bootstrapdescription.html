    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
         It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation,
          and other interface components.
          Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter. 
          It was released as an open source product in August 2011 on GitHub.</p>
